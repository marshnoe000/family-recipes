  title: Family Recipes
  description: |-
    The purpose of Family Recipes is to make sharing recipes easier. Instead of asking for Grandma’s old chocolate chip cookie recipe that has been kept on the same piece of paper for decades, users can save and share recipes with their families and other groups from Family Recipes. Users are also able to view recipes shared with them from various groups in a format similar to social media. Family Recipes allows users to easily see recipes recommended by people they know and share their favorite recipes with others.
